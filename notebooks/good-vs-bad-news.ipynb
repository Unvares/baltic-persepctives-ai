    "# Good vs Bad News\n",
    "\n",
    "Consuming only bad news can have several detrimental effects on mental health:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Increased Anxiety and Stress**: Constant exposure to negative news can lead to heightened levels of anxiety and stress. This is because the human brain is wired to respond to threats, and bad news can trigger a continuous state of alertness or fear.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Depression**: Regular intake of negative news can contribute to feelings of hopelessness and despair, which are key features of depression. The perception that the world is overwhelmingly negative can lead to a pessimistic outlook on life.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Desensitization**: Overexposure to bad news can cause desensitization, where individuals become numb or indifferent to distressing events. This can diminish empathy and reduce the ability to respond compassionately to real-world issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Distorted Worldview**: Consuming only bad news can skew an individual’s perception of reality. It can create a belief that the world is more dangerous and hostile than it actually is, leading to a lack of trust in others and societal institutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Chronic Worry**: Bad news often focuses on events beyond one's control, which can result in chronic worry. This sense of helplessness can exacerbate feelings of anxiety and stress, leading to a vicious cycle of negative thoughts.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Physical Health Impacts**: Mental health and physical health are closely linked. Chronic stress and anxiety from constant exposure to bad news can lead to physical health problems such as headaches, digestive issues, and a weakened immune system.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Behavioral Changes**: The psychological effects of consuming bad news can lead to behavioral changes such as social withdrawal, reduced engagement in activities, and a reluctance to take risks or try new things.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Cognitive Bias**: Constant exposure to bad news can reinforce cognitive biases such as the \"negativity bias,\" where individuals are more likely to pay attention to and remember negative information. This can further perpetuate a cycle of negative thinking.\n",
    "\n",
    "To mitigate these effects, it’s important to balance news consumption with positive news and engage in activities that promote mental well-being, such as exercise, hobbies, and social interactions. Being mindful of media consumption and setting limits on exposure to distressing news can also help maintain a healthier mental state.\n",
    "\n",
    "One approach could be to search the normal news stream for bad news and, based on this, search for good news on the same topics and introduce this good news into a news stream.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this naturally leads to the question of how to find good news and how to find bad news.\n",
    "\n",
    "But before we start, we install some libraries necessary to get this notebook working."

    "\n",
    "The results are somewhat depressing. Bad news is surprisingly easy to find. Deaths, accidents and abuse are the normal news that is reported. Ask yourself. What interests you more, news about an honest politician or a corrupt one? Normality is not news. If something is going well, it's not news. If a politician is honest, it is not news. If there hasn't been an accident at the crossroads in front of the kindergarten for ten years, it's not news either. Until a child is hit by a car. Then a crossroads with excellent accident statistics becomes news and our perception immediately changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's a general problem; it's the market mechanism that journalism is subject to. This is how our attention economy works.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, finding good news is far more complicated than finding bad news. Bad news is everywhere; good news is rare. But there are news outlets that deliberately focus on providing only good news in order to break through this mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you search for \"good news\" on Google, you will find links like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- https://thegoodnewshub.com\n",
    "- https://goodnews.eu\n",
    "- https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org\n",
    "- https://squirrel-news.net\n",
    "- ...\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, we can search for news, but this time we limit it to positive/constructive news outlets, and since these are rare, we consider all articles in these outlets' RSS feeds."
